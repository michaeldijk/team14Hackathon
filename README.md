## USERS
St Patrick’s Day in 2021 is very different to other years. We are not allowed to celebrate the day going to see a parade, gathering with families and friends so we create this website to help them to celebrate the day and to give them the atmosphere of the special day.

## OWNER
Member of The Blarney Bunch (Michael Dijk, Henrique Peroni, Stefan D Yordanov, Szilvia Gombarovics, Tashi Sk, Toto Tanaka). Our goal is to create a website that gives users a same feeling about St Patrick’s Day as every other years.<br>
We are in the different stage of learning in Code Institute, however we all learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, and use those technologies to build the website. 
Each of us have different knowledges and techniques so we put those from each individual and put together. 

## UX 5 PLANES
### Strategy Plane
Users are people who would like to celebrate St Patrick Day same year as usual but without going to see a parade, or gathering with families and friends. The main image of the website gives a feeling of St Patrick’s Day to users, then, there is a section to explain about St Patrick’s Day. There are some images of St Patrick’s Day that show celebrations in different countries. There is a fun game at the end of the website to entertain users.

### Scope Plane
Features to be included in this project are;
-   Main image to give users a feeling about St Patrick’s Day
-   About Section to give / remind users what St Patrick Day is like
-   Gallery Section to show users images of St Patrick’s Day in other countries
-   Game Section to entertain users

### Structure Plane
The website consists of 4 sections on a page
Home Section with a logo, a navigation bar, main image with a welcome message<br>
About Section explains what St Patrick’s Day is like<br>

-  [GitHub](https://github.com/) for online version control, keeping the files, documents and deploying the website

## TESTING
<!--- If we have time --->

## CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS
We only have a few days to work on the project. There are 6 people in the team but we do not know each other and we all have life apart from coding so it is not easy to have a meeting with everyone or allocate the same amount of tasks on each person. Therefore, we decide the rule for the meeting that if a few people available, then, we go ahead a meeting and someone on a meeting lead it and someone takes a note. Then, whatever discussed in the meeting is passed on the team slack. Slack is our main communication tool and GitHub is our main tool to keep the tasks. We also help out the others in case anyone isn’t available to do allocated tasks. Keeping clear rules and following them make the project going on.     

## VERSION CONTROL
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) as a local repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository are used for the project.

## DEPLOYMENT
The website is deployed in [GitHub](https://github.com/) as it can host open-source projects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
