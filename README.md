## USERS
St Patrick’s Day in 2021 is very different to other years. We are not allowed to celebrate the day going to see a parade, gathering with families and friends so we create this website to help them to celebrate the day and to give them the atmosphere of the special day.

## OWNER
Member of Team14Hackathon (Michael Dijk, Henrique Peroni, Stefan D Yordanov, Szilvia Gombarovics, Tashi Sk, Toto Tanaka). Our goal is to create a website that gives users a same feeling about St Patrick’s Day as every other years.

## UX 5 PLANES
### Strategy Plane
Users are people who would like to celebrate St Patrick Day same year as usual but without going to see a parade, or gathering with families and friends. The main image of the website gives a feeling of St Patrick’s Day to users, then, there is a section to explain about St Patrick’s Day. There are some images of St Patrick’s Day that show celebrations in different countries. There is a fun game at the end of the website to entertain users.

### Scope Plane
Features to be included in this project are;
* Main image to give users a feeling about St Patrick’s Day
* About Section to give / remind users what St Patrick Day is like 
* Gallery Section to show users images of St Patrick’s Day in other countries
* Game Section to entertain users

### Structure Plane
The website consists of 4 sections on a page
Home Section (header) with a logo, a navigation bar, main image with a welcome message<br>
About Section explains what St Patrick’s Day is like<br>
Gallery Section shows images of St Patricks Day in other countries<br>
